# Limit Visibility To Own

## Important: this plugin has been now included in a broader plugin,  <a href="https://github.com/DBinaghi/plugin-AdminTools" target="_blank">Admin Tools</a>, therefore there won't be any more updates/releases of it as a stand-alone plugin. Please refer to Admin Tools' pages for issues and updates.


## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Once installed and activated, allows to limit, while in Admin mode, the visibility of Items and/or Collections
to just the ones the user have contributed. Visibility rights are allocated by user role.

Please note: this plugin **does** not restrict access to Items or Collections, so anybody using a direct URL or a specific plugin (like Collection Tree plugin, for instance) will still be able to display the targeted Item or Collection.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "LimitVisibilityToOwn".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.

## Troubleshooting
